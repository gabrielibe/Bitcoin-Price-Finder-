# CoinSight

CoinSight is an elegantly simple application designed to provide you with the latest Bitcoin price in USD and a multitude of other currencies. A sleek, minimalistic user interface, my focus has been on the backend workings. This project tested and solidified my understanding of APIs, making it a challenging but rewarding endeavor.
